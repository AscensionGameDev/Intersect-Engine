Intersect Engine with 100% more bunny hops!

 

##About

Intersect Platformer Edition is a 2D tile-based side-scroller engine using Intersect Engine.

This engine is currently in a very basic state and will be improved.

##Features

###Platform tile type

Allows players to jump from below the tile landing on top and fall through the tile when desired

###Jumping ability

Ability to jump at a fixed jump height with server checks to prevent jump hacks

##Planned Features

###Ladder tile type

Ladder tile that a player can climb and animation for climbing

###Jump animation

Animations for jumping and falling (Using the new pipeline!)

Feel free to suggest something!

##Source Mod Compatibility

Anything that doesn't deal with Player.cs or Entity.cs on server on client side should work.

If it changes anything with player movement or animations, It most likely wont work.
 
##Help and or bug finds

Please make a reply here with the necessary info.

##Known Bugs

If a player jumps into a moving npc, they will be frozen in place

NPCs need to have a npc avoid on the edge of platforms

##Special Thanks

Shenmue - Without the Diagonal movement mod this wouldn't have been possible
