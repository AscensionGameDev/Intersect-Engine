# Intersect Engine

Intersect provides a complete game development suite for creating 2d mmorpgs with no programming experience or difficult setup steps required! Intersect is powered by [MonoGame](http://monogame.net), and has been designed with stability and performance in mind. Intersect comes with [custom assets](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Assets) that are free to use in your projects (even commercially) meaning that you can start developing your game in minutes!

## Automated Builds

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Engine/actions) for building and packaging the latest updates for the engine. Releases with downloadable bundles can be found on the [Releases page on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Engine/releases).

## Supported Platforms

Please refer to the [Requirements](./REQUIREMENTS.md) document for support matrices.

Our editor uses DirectX and must be ran in Windows, but you can host and play your game on any desktop os that supports OpenGL.

We're open to expanding to new platforms (mobile, web, etc) but don't have the capacity to do so at this time. If you're interested in helping out let us know!

## Compiling/Development

### Dependencies

#### Required

- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0), verified for v7.0.11 (SDK 7.0.401)

#### Optional (strongly recommended)

- git: required for cloning submodules, if you want to do this manually this is not needed
  - Tested on 2.42.0

### Getting started

After cloning, run `scripts/clone.sh` for non-Windows systems, and `scripts/clone.ps1` for Windows
- On all platforms this clones any submodules via `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Via the .sh file it will also disable the Windows-only editor via `git apply disable-windows-editor.patch`

### Compiling

To compile either use an IDE or one of the following commands:
- `dotnet build -p:Configuration=Debug -p:PackageVersion=0.8.0-beta -p:Version=0.8.0`
  - Debug builds, all debug builds will _not_ create single-file binary outputs
- `dotnet build -p:Configuration=Release -p:PackageVersion=0.8.0-beta -p:Version=0.8.0`
	- Release builds will create single-file binary outputs but to get a clean output use `dotnet publish`
- `dotnet publish -p:Configuration=Release -p:PackageVersion=0.8.0-beta -p:Version=0.8.0 -r <runtime-id>`
	- e.g. `dotnet publish -p:Configuration=Release -p:PackageVersion=0.8.0-beta -p:Version=0.8.0 -r linux-x64`
	- The automated builds use the above command for the RIDs `linux-x64`, `osx-x64` and `win-x64`

## Intersect Assets

Intersect is distributed with [custom assets](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Assets) that have been curated from our community and around the net. Assets all match in style and are all safe to use freely in commercial projects.
