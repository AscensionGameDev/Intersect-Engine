# Intersect Engine

Intersect provides a complete game development suite for creating 2d mmorpgs with no programming experience or difficult setup steps required! Intersect is powered by [MonoGame](http://monogame.net), and has been designed with stability and performance in mind. Intersect comes with [custom assets](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Assets) that are free to use in your projects (even commercially) meaning that you can start developing your game in minutes!
