# Licensing

## Making a game?

In short, you are allowed to create games with Intersect and distribute, sell, or otherwise make money off your games without paying any licensing fees to the development community of Intersect, and without disclosing the source code of your game to your users.

## Making free and public improvements to the engine?

We ask that if you are making improvements to the engine that you do not intend to charge for, that you take a look at our [guidelines for contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the engine, and if your improvements meet the spirit of the engine please work with us on integrating your changes into the engine itself.

## Commercializing improvements to the engine?

It is recommended that you read this document (and linked license files) in full before making any sales of your improvements to ensure you are not violating any licenses.

While we support other developers using their skills to make a living by making improvements to Intersect, as this is an open source project we do have several of the components of Intersect licensed in a way that requires that you disclose any source modifications to your customers (but not the general public), as they are not required to be publicly distributed (e.g. the server is not distributed to players).

Please see [below](#non-publicly-distributed-compilables-gpl-v3) for more details.

## Further details

Intersect as a whole is divided into several different projects, each with their own licenses based on their expected distribution.
