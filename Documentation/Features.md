## Server

### Homepage

This is a sample preview of the server built-in homepage, which includes a very basic leaderboard as well as user login/logout.

**By default the server does not have the assets to serve the in-game graphics as shown in the screenshot below, it requires a manual step. If you would like to see the in-game graphics please follow the instructions for the [AvatarController](./AvatarController/AvatarController.md).**
